# Arrow-Based Navigation using YOLOv8 and ROS
## Overview
This project implements an autonomous arrow-based navigation system using ROS, YOLOv8, and Gazebo simulation. The system integrates a webcam to detect arrows in real-time and directs a simulated rover accordingly. When an arrow is detected, the rover changes its direction based on the arrowâ€™s orientation.
## Features
- YOLOv8-based arrow detection for real-time decision-making.
- Gazebo simulation for testing rover navigation in a virtual environment.
- Webcam integration to detect arrows in real-world scenarios.
- ROS-based control to process detections and adjust rover movement.
## Prerequisites
- ROS Noetic
- Gazebo
- OpenCV
- YOLOv8 (Ultralytics)
- Python 3.x
